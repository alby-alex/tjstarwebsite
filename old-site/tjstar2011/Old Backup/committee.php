<b>IBET Liaisons</b><br />

This will involve finding out what the teachers need in the way of classroom setup and technology, ways to accommodate parents and guests, scheduling the presentations with other TjSTAR activities, and coordinating with the Senior Tech Lab Liaisons about joint scheduling possibilities.<br />
<b>Senior Tech Lab Liaisons</b><br />
This committee will be in charge of communicating with Senior Tech Lab Directors to prepare for senior project presentations. (See "IBET Liaisons" for specific details) This is a good way to get to know the directors and talk to them before applying to their Tech Labs!<br />
<b>Speakers and Panels</b><br />
This committee will work with TjSTAR faculty members to invite researchers from the fields of science, math, and technology to serve on panels. Students will be liaisons to visiting speakers. <br />

<b>Advertising Subcommittee: Banners, Posters & Fliers</b><br />
Are you artistic? This committee will be in charge of creating "wall art" to get students involved in and excited about TjSTAR. This will involve advertising the event and its special attractions like guest speakers, companies, and design challenges.<br />
<b>Website Crew</b><br />
Are you creative, organized, and/or experienced in website maintenance? We have lots of ideas about how the TjSTAR website could be improved and expanded.

<b>Scheduling</b><br />
This committee will help Mrs. Sandstrom and other faculty volunteers to get in touch with and stay updated on the availabilities of our guest speakers and visiting companies. This will involve fielding phone calls and emails, and coordinating the master schedule to make sure our guests are accommodated.<br />
<b>Scheduling Subcommittee: Program Committee</b><br />
Work closely with Scheduling and Advertising Committees to put together the printed program.<br />
<b>Technology</b><br />
This committee will be in charge of preparing everything our guest speakers and visiting groups need to conduct their lectures or activities: powerpoints and other programs, demonstration materials, microphones and speakers, laptop accommodations, etc.<br />
<b>Hospitality/Information</b><br />
This committee will greet, set up registration, organize hospitality room, lunch, T shirts and gift bags for our speakers and guests, etc. If you were a part of the committee this year and would like to be a leader for it next year, please mention that on your form!<br /><br />
