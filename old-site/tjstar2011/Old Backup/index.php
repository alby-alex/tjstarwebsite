<blockquote><i style="">&ldquo;I am excited about our symposium this year because it gives us an opportunity to celebrate our students' research far beyond those who win Intel awards.&nbsp;
I want this symposium to be a success for our students &ndash; an
opportunity for them
to learn from one another, be inspired about opportunities at TJ, and
interact
with different role models across different sectors of society,
including our
alumni.&nbsp; 
I want our students to observe professionals who tackle scientific and technological challenges and
