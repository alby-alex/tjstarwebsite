<td class="main topic">CubeSat (All Blocks)</td>
<td class="main">TJ CubeSat is the world's first satellite fully designed, deeloped and engineered by high school students. The primary mission is to create an educational outreach by creating resources through which other K-12 institutions can learn about aerospace engineering and look into careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The satellite itself will be carrying a voice synthesizer. Students will be able to send text strings to the satellite. This text will then be converted to voice and transmitted back to the ground on HAM radio frequencies. We will potentially launch June 2011.</td>
