<h1>Panels</h1>

<p>
Panels are interactive sessions involving student discussion on issues ranging from neuroethics to global warming. Panelists will provide students with a brief overview of their experience in the panel's topic, and after these introductions, students are invited to address a question to any or all of the panelists relating to the panel topic.

<p>
We will coordinate communication between panelists prior to the symposium in the hope that panelists will be able to prepare for the event with the group in mind. We encourage panelists to reach out to others in their respective fields both to gather opinions and invite others to participate in TJSTAR.
