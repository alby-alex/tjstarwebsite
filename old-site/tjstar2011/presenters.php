<td class="main">The Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection has become the de-facto standard for both charging and data transfers for smart phone devices including Google's Android and Apple's iPhone. To further enhance their functionality, smart phones are equipped with programmable USB hardware and open source operating systems that empower them to alter the default behavior of the end-to-end USB communications. Unfortunately, these new capabilities coupled with the inherent trust that users place on the USB physical connectivity and the lack of any protection mechanisms render USB a insecure link, prone to exploitation. To demonstrate this new avenue of exploitation, we introduce novel attack strategies that exploit the functional capabilities of the USB physical link. In addition, we detail how a sophisticated adversary who has under his control one of the connected devices can subvert the other. (And much more.)</td>

The results found that unnecessary errors in US Hospitals lead to as many as 98,000 deaths per year. The Airline Industry has been using flight simulators to train commercial pilots for decades and is now considered one of the safest industries. Medical simulation is a relatively new field that enables doctors, nurses and other health professionals to work together in a simulated environment, on a high fidelity mannequin or virtual reality trainer, prior to real patient encounters. These mannequins are capable of breathing, blinking, sweating, talking, and responding to drugs as though they were managing a real patient.

<td class="main">For some of you the Internet could be a medium but for us at Verisign, it’s our core business. As the global registry for domain names such as the .com and .net, managing &amp; monitoring the Internet infrastructure every second of the day is an exciting experience. We see billions of users and transactions on the internet and we are responsible for ensuring the smooth running of this virtual world! In this presentation, we would like to take you through the underlying technologies that power the Internet including Facebook, Google, Twitter and also discuss some of the new generation services such as QR codes, audio URLs that are on the horizon. Welcome to the world of the Internet you have assumed you know! Well, there is so much more.</td>

<td class="main topic">Medical Simulation: Using technology to improve patient care</td>
<td class="main">In 1999, the Institute for Medicine (IOM) published a study entitled, "To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System." The results found that unnecessary errors in US Hospitals lead to as many as 98,000 deaths per year. The Airline Industry has been using flight simulators to train commercial pilots for decades and is now considered one of the safest industries. Medical simulation is a relatively new field that enables doctors, nurses and other health professionals to work together in a simulated environment, on a high fidelity mannequin or virtual reality trainer, prior to real patient encounters. These mannequins are capable of breathing, blinking, sweating, talking, and responding to drugs as though they were managing a real patient. This session will give an overview of the use of simulation technology in medical training and discuss next steps in potential areas for research.</td>

<td class="main">There are lots of kinds of important research that do not take place in a lab and are outside the sciences, many which do not even involve much math but are nonetheless rigorous and demanding. Learn about the kinds of work done by policy researchers (particularly in education policy) and the different strengths of quantitative (i.e. having to do with numbers) and qualitative (having to do with word) and quantitative research. We will explore these issues through the question, "Should there be more high schools like TJ?"</td>

Cutting edge research to decipher the causes of autism, childhood cancer and other diseases is complex and ongoing. EPA supports this research focused on children's health and develops science policies to appropriately account for risks to children from toxicity, exposure or both. Participants will learn about all of this and more.</td>

<td class="main topic">Measuring the Effects of Climate Change</td>
<td class="main">A major topic of interdisciplinary research currently funded by government agencies is how we can measure the uncertain effects of climate change. This requires the combined efforts of experts in high-performance computing, mathematics, geophysics, and economics, among others. The presentation would provide an introduction to the challenges involved and methods employed in answering this important question. The complexity of the material can be adjusted based on the proficiency of the audience in economics, computing, and mathematics.</td>
