<h1>Displays/Demonstrations</h1>


Each guest involved with the Displays and Demonstration category will be situated at individual booths in a large area of the school, allowing for students to visit each booth at their leisure. Guests wishing to be part of the Displays and Demonstrations are encouraged to bring interactive media and hands-on activities that high school students with technological interests would enjoy.
